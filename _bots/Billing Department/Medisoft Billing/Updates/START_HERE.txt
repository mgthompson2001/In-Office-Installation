                    UPDATE SYSTEM - START HERE
================================================================================

YOU ARE HERE: You have an update system that lets you push updates to all
employees automatically without touching their computers!

================================================================================
                          FIRST TIME SETUP
================================================================================

1. Double-click: SETUP.bat
   (This sets up version tracking - only do this once)

2. That's it! You're ready to push updates.

================================================================================
                    HOW TO PUSH UPDATES (EVERY TIME)
================================================================================

When you make changes to your bots and want everyone to get them:

1. Make your changes to bot files (edit code, fix bugs, etc.)

2. Double-click: PUSH_UPDATE.bat
   - It will ask for version number (like 1.0.1)
   - It will ask what you changed (like "Fixed login bug")
   - It does everything else automatically!

3. Done! Employees will see updates when they start their bots.

================================================================================
                          HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

YOUR COMPUTER:
- You edit bots in: In-Office Installation folder
- You run PUSH_UPDATE.bat
- Files go to: G:\Company\Software\Updates

EMPLOYEES' COMPUTERS:
- Bots are installed locally on their computers
- When they start a bot, it checks G:\Company\Software\Updates
- If update found → Popup asks "Update now?"
- If they click "Yes" → Bot updates itself automatically
- Their data (passwords, settings) stays safe

================================================================================
                          FILES IN THIS FOLDER
================================================================================

SETUP.bat              - Run this ONCE to set everything up
PUSH_UPDATE.bat        - Run this EVERY TIME you want to push updates
HOW_TO_USE.md          - Detailed instructions (if you need them)

================================================================================
                          THAT'S IT!
================================================================================

You don't need to know anything else. Just:
- Run SETUP.bat once
