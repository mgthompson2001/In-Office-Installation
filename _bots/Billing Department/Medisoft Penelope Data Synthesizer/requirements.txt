# Medisoft/Penelope Data Synthesizer - Required Dependencies
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or run: install.bat (double-click to install)

# Core dependencies (REQUIRED)
pandas>=2.0.0  # REQUIRED for reading and writing Excel files
openpyxl>=3.1.0  # REQUIRED for reading/writing .xlsx Excel files
pdfplumber>=0.11.0  # REQUIRED for extracting data from PDF files

# Note: pdfplumber automatically installs its dependencies:
#   - pdfminer.six (core PDF parsing library)
#   - Pillow (image processing, usually already installed)
#
# pdfplumber works with standard text-based PDFs and PDFs with tables.
# For scanned PDFs (image-based), additional OCR tools may be needed,
# but most transaction list PDFs are text-based and will work fine.
