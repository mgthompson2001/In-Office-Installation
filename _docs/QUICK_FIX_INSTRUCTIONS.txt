QUICK FIX: See All Computers in Update Manager
==============================================

PROBLEM: You only see one computer because each computer stores data locally.

SOLUTION: Create a shared folder that all computers can access.

STEP 1: Create Shared Folder on Company Drive
---------------------------------------------
1. Right-click on "setup_company_shared_drive.bat" in this folder
2. Run it and enter your company shared drive path
3. Example: \\server\shared or \\fileserver\company
4. Wait for it to complete

STEP 2: Restart Update Manager on ALL Computers
-----------------------------------------------
1. Close the update manager on all computers
2. Reopen the update manager on all computers
3. All computers should now appear in the list

STEP 3: Verify It's Working
---------------------------
1. Open the update manager on any computer
2. You should see all computers listed
3. Each computer should show as "Online"

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If computers still don't appear, check Windows Firewall
- Make sure all computers are on the same network
- Try running the shared folder script as administrator

ALTERNATIVE: Manual Setup on Company Drive
------------------------------------------
If the script doesn't work:
1. Navigate to your company shared drive (e.g., \\server\shared)
2. Create folder: CCMD_Bot_Manager
3. Right-click folder > Properties > Security
4. Click "Edit" > "Add" > "Everyone" > "Full Control"
5. Restart update manager on all computers

The shared folder will be at: \\YOUR_SERVER\CCMD_Bot_Manager
