# Safe to Delete Old Folders

## ✅ Safe to Delete

The following folders are **EMPTY** and can be safely deleted:

1. **`_ai_intelligence/`** - Empty (contents moved to `AI/intelligence/`)
2. **`_ai_models/`** - Empty (contents moved to `AI/models/`)

## ✅ Verification

- ✅ Both folders are confirmed empty
- ✅ All contents successfully moved to `AI/` folder
- ✅ All code paths updated to reference new locations
- ✅ Master AI Dashboard updated
- ✅ All training and intelligence modules updated

## ⚠️ Note

Some documentation files in `_system/` may still reference the old paths in comments or examples, but these are just documentation and won't affect functionality.

## How to Delete

You can safely delete these folders:
- `C:\Users\mthompson\OneDrive - Integrity Senior Services\Desktop\In-Office Installation\_ai_intelligence`
- `C:\Users\mthompson\OneDrive - Integrity Senior Services\Desktop\In-Office Installation\_ai_models`

## After Deletion

All AI functionality will continue to work from the new `AI/` folder structure.
